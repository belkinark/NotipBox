### NotipBox v1.0

## This is an analogue of the game **JackBox** implemented in discord.

The game features only 1 mode so far
# **Modes:**
```
> Pricolist - an analog of the Quiplash mode from JackBox.
> Skazka na noch - in development
> Rap batalia - in development
```

The game also has voice acting implemented using the **PyTorch** library using **[Silero TTS](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models)**.

The game is implemented in Russian, you can translate all messages into your language (If you translate, do not forget to change the code in `utils/silero.py`).

# I would be grateful if you offer your ideas for improving the game and modes.
