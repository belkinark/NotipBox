# NotipBox v1.0

This is an analogue of the game **JackBox** implemented in discord.

### **Modes:**
```
1. Pricolist - an analog of the Quiplash mode from JackBox.
2. Skazka na noch - in development
3. Rap batalia - in development
```

The game features only 1 mode so far

The game also has voice acting implemented using the **PyTorch** library using **[Silero TTS](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models)**.
The game is implemented in Russian, you can translate all messages into your language (If you translate, do not forget to change the code in `utils/silero.py`).

**I would be grateful if you offer your ideas for improving the game and modes.**
